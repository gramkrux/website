<p>&nbsp;</p>
You’re lost in the Cocain World<br />
The way in is just a sniff<br />
The way out is hard like a drift<br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
In your high the kingdom is your‘s<br />
It feels like there are no tears<br />
But the truth is just plain fear<br />
<br />
Cocain World - You feel it’s true<br />
Cocain World - You create the rules<br />
Cocain World<br />
Cocain World<br />
No way out in your Cocain World<br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Getting high is right next door<br />
You still ask for more and more<br />
No regret even when you‘re down on the floor<br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Sympathy of friends means nothing to you<br />
The kick is worth even more<br />
You loose your self and can’t see the war<br />
<br />
Cocain World - It creeps inside you<br />
Cocain World - Your heart pumps like a whore<br />
Cocain World<br />
Cocain World<br />
No way out in your Cocain World<br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The lights are blinding<br />
Your feelings are colliding<br />
You ask for help but the silence makes you dumb<br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
You need to fight against your soul<br />
To keep you still in any control<br />
Don‘t loose your mind or you will die in the<br />
<br />
Cocain World - Not far away from day zero<br />
Cocain World - I love to play with it no more<br />
Cocain World<br />
Cocain World<br />
I need help to restore<br />
