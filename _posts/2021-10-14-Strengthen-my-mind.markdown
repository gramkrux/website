<p>&nbsp;</p>
It’s not a crime to strengthen my mind<br />
My Thoughts need to be thought<br />
Conclusions bring faith to my being here<br />
The world is full of crap and spins my brain<br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
I need to think about things<br />
No matter how hard it feels<br />
I don’t have fear to go deep inside me<br />
Even though it really hurts from time to time<br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
I often feel like a jerk<br />
Is it true that I see it different in so many ways<br />
Does it mean I am wrong or am I the only one<br />
Who can see the truth and what it really means<br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
I can’t get my head around the things I see<br />
It simply just can’t be<br />
The piss and shit we think is good for humanity<br />
We loose it all and can’t stay for it much more<br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
I go deep inside my heart and feel<br />
It hurts - it crushes my soul - it breaks my heart<br />
Don’t we all just want the same?<br />
A truthful life in a world we all need?<br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
I keep digging my faith<br />
I try to be my self and spread the word<br />
About the simplest thing in the world<br />
Humanity - respect - the truth and Love for us all<br />
