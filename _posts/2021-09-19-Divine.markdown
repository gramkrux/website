Shall I live or shall I die?<br />
Shall I die or shall I live?<br />
<br />
Why do I ask myself such things?<br />
Because it is simply divine!<br />
<br />
No fear I shall have!<br />
Everything is really just in my sick mind!<br />
<br />
I Love my Life!<br />
I Love my girls!<br />
I Love my Friends!<br />
I Love my dog!<br />
I love everything and I donâ€™t want to ask why! <br />
<br />
It is simple!<br />
It is easy!<br />
<br />
No need to hurdle!<br />
No reason to not trust myself!<br />
<br />
I am strong!<br />
I know what I want!<br />
I have a plan!<br />
I have friends!<br />
I have a family I love!<br />
I have a dog I love!<br />
<br />
They believe in me!<br />
They trust me!<br />
They need me!<br />
They love me!<br />
They need me!<br />
They like me!<br />
They need me!<br />
They count on me!<br />
<br />
I am good like I am!<br />
I trust myself!<br />
I need myself!<br />
I can do whatever I want!<br />
I trust myself!<br />
I believe in me!<br />
