<p>&nbsp;</p>
People like me are not people like you.
You are not like me.
And I am not like you.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The swirl in my mind is different.
Thinking is a glorious way of expression.
It needs thorough preparation.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
After reading stuff from people like you.
My mind is collapsing in dark.
The shit is so unbeliveable.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
You don't think because you can't.
Maybe it is too complex for your shitty brain.
Filled with rubish you suck every day.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Repeating what others say is stupid.
Using it as of your own making is ridiculous.
Spreading it as the true words is ruthless sabotage.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
People like need to fought against.
With words as our arms.
And you are the target.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
_About endless shit that is presented in the media manipulating people with semantical obfuscation._
