I can’t say no<br />
I have no control<br />
Another one is just a go<br />
<br />
Alcohol
<p>&nbsp;</p>
I like to say no to no<br />
It does not feel like a no though<br />
I say no to no<br />
<br />
Alcohol
<p>&nbsp;</p>
One more show<br />
Baby it’s just a go<br />
Don’t treat me like a cow<br />
<br />
Alcohol
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Sipping a bit of taste<br />
It’s just for the human race<br />
The world is mine in just one day<br />
<br />
Alcohol
<p>&nbsp;</p>
My mind is crazy<br />
I can’t say I’m sorry<br />
Cuz I never worry<br />
<br />
Alcohol
<p>&nbsp;</p>
It makes me feel so good<br />
I don’t blame anyone but me<br />
I just can’t see what it means<br />
<br />
Alcohol
<p>&nbsp;</p>
My daily thing? No!<br />
Just a bit of a Swing<br />
Can’t you see I am not in?<br />
<br />
Alcohol
<p>&nbsp;</p>
A zig, a whisky and a wine<br />
Charles stays just behind<br />
And I am feeling fine<br />
<br />
Alcohol
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Red men play it like a game<br />
Why can’t I just do the same?<br />
Is it like a crime?<br />
<br />
Alcohol
<p>&nbsp;</p>
I give a fuck on my divine<br />
I just wanna feel fine<br />
For a moment for a dime<br />
<br />
Alcohol
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Restless in this day<br />
Wanna leave it all behind<br />
That’s so simply in my mind<br />
<br />
Alcohol
<p>&nbsp;</p>
You see I have no objections<br />
A little washing my brain<br />
Fuck - it’s just a Game<br />
<br />
Alcohol
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Makes me feel my way<br />
I need to keep on the track<br />
No way I will hurt my back<br />
<br />
Alcohol
