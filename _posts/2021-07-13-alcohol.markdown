I can’t say no I have no control Another one is just a go

Alcohol

I like to say no to no It does not feel like a no though I say no to no

Alcohol

One more show Baby it’s just a go Don’t treat me like a cow

Alcohol

Sipping a bit of taste It’s just for the human race The world is mine in just one day

Alcohol

My mind is crazy I can’t say I’m sorry Cuz I never worry

Alcohol

It makes me feel so good I don’t blame anyone but me I just can’t see what it means

Alcohol

My daily thing? No! Just a bit of a Swing Can’t you see I am not in?

Alcohol

A zig, a whisky and a wine Charles stays just behind And I am feeling fine

Alcohol

Red men play it like a game Why can’t I just do the same? Is it like a crime?

Alcohol

I give a fuck on my divine I just wanna feel fine For a moment for a dime

Alcohol

Restless in this daY Wanna leave it all behind That’s so simply in my mind

Alcohol

You see I have no objections A little washing my brain Fuck - it’s just a Game

Alcohol

Makes me feel my way I need to keep on the track No way I will hurt my back

Alcohol
