<p>&nbsp;</p>
Having a peaceful Night<br />
Some drinks make it comfortable and delight<br />
Stress is falling of my mind<br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
My thoughts try to run me wild<br />
But in a sudden I realize<br />
There’s peace on my mind<br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Good music in the back<br />
Giving me a lot of rest<br />
Making me think it’s all right<br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Rob singing out his tunes<br />
Surprising me with his mood<br />
A farwell to arms is grabbing my thoughts<br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Reading a lot is opening my mind<br />
Gives me a smile in my mind<br />
Hemingway is one I remind<br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
War is a cruel thing in the world<br />
So much has been said<br />
So much we shall learn<br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Why can’t it stop?<br />
Why do we still destruct ourselfs?<br />
Why can’t we stop?<br />
<br />
We have so much to learn!<br /> 
<br />
We have to listen to the past!<br />
