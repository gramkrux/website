I don’t care if I get fired<br />
Because I don’t know why I should be<br /> 
I don’t care if I die<br />
Because I don’t know when it’s time<br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
I don’t care if I am drunk<br />
Because I don’t know when I will be<br />
I don’t care if I am ill<br />
Because I‘ve never been<br />
<br />
I care about the truth<br />
I care about my beloved<br />
I care about the world<br />
I care about you and me<br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
I don’t care about money<br />
Because money does not make me free<br />
I don’t care if you think you‘re not free<br />
Because your mind should always be<br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
I don’t care about hate<br />
Because hate is not what I feel<br />
I don’t care about business in any way<br />
Because it’s just a virtual thing we dream<br />
<br />
I care about the truth<br />
I care about my beloved<br />
I care about the world<br />
I care about you and me<br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
I don’t care if you don’t care<br />
Because I care about you<br />
I don’t care if you don’t know what friends mean<br />
Because friendship ist the essence of what I need<br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
I don’t care about religion in any way<br />
Because it‘s a lie and pain for humanity<br />
I don’t care if you can’t understand me<br />
Because it’s the way I think each night and day<br />
<br />
I care about the truth<br />
I care about my beloved<br />
I care about the world<br />
I care about you and me<br />
